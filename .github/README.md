# ‚è´ Modpack Uploader

Modpack Uploader is a script that can automatically upload modpacks to CurseForge.

Almost everything can be toggled on/off in the settings.

# üöß Getting Started

1. Download the latest release, and unzip it into your modpack instance.
   - You can place it in a subfolder, but you need to change the `$INSTANCE_ROOT` in the `settings.ps1` file.
2. Fill in the `settings.ps1` file with your modpack information.
3. Fill in the `secrets.ps1` file with your CurseForge Upload API Token.
4. Run the `modpack-uploader.ps1` when you're ready to upload your modpack.
